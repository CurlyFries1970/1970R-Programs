![GitHub last commit (by committer)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/CurlyFries1970/CurlyFries-Match)

## For Judges
- The skills folder is currently unused. Our skills auton is built into the main program.
- All files are setup (Vex auto-generated) except for the files in the **["CurlyFries-Match/src" folder](https://github.com/CurlyFries1970/1970R-Programs/tree/main/CurlyFries-Match/src "Click to view online copy")**, which are completely written by me.
- I wrote a quick summary of some program features at the beginning of the **["main.cpp" file](https://github.com/CurlyFries1970/1970R-Programs/blob/main/CurlyFries-Match/src/main.cpp "Click to view online copy")**.
